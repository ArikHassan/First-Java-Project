# FirstJavaProject

## Project Description
Hi there, my name is Arik Hassan and this is my first project in Java.
I'm super excited to document my journey to becoming an expert in using Java to build professional apps. In this simple program I'll demonstrate some basic knowledge of the Java
language.

### Concepts covered in this application:
- Printing strings
- Reading user input using "Scanner"
- Variables (int, string, double, boolean)
- String concatenation
- Conditional statements
- Getting date using "LocalDate"
- Arithmetic operators (+, -, %, /)
- Logical operators (ternary (? a:b))
- String --> int, double, boolean - conversions

### Important concepts learned
- Using nextInt leaves a newline in the buffer. This causes the subsequent
nextLine call to consume the newline and nothing else resulting in an empty
string
- Integer.valueOf returns an Integer wrapper object whereas Integer.parseInt
returns a primitive int value
