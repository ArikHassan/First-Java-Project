# FirstJavaProject
Hi there, my name is Arik Hassan and this is my first project in Java.
I'm super excited to document my journey to becoming an expert in using Java to build professional apps. In this simple program I'll demonstrate some basic knowledge of the Java
language. In this small project I have built a Command Line app that prompts the user for
some input and generates varying responses based on that input.

## Project Description


### Concepts covered in this application:
- Printing strings
- Reading user input using "Scanner"
- Variables (int, string, double, boolean)
- String concatenation
- Conditional statements
- Getting date using "LocalDate"
- Arithmetic operators (+, -, %, /)
- Logical operators (ternary (? a:b))
- String --> int, double, boolean - conversions
- String comparison

### Important concepts learned
- Using nextInt leaves a newline in the buffer. This causes the subsequent
nextLine call to consume the newline and nothing else resulting in an empty
string

- Integer.valueOf returns an Integer wrapper object whereas Integer.parseInt
returns a primitive int value

- Using println includes a newline character whereas printf does not and can be
used for formatting output text

- Strings can be compared using string.equals(str) method

### Conclusion
The purpose of this application is to get familiar with the fundamentals of
Java syntax. I feel confident that this is a good starting point, though
there is still much more to learn! Happy coding!
